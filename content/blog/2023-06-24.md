Ok the blog posting program is so sick.

I am writing this post entirely remotely, I won't even have to touch the git repo to get this to work!

I'm gonna be double checking like crazy anyways, because I want to make sure I check all of the possible edge cases and such, but this is very exciting.

I'm hoping to be able to compile my program into an Android APK so I can run it on my phone and do remote blog posts from anywhere, but we'll see.

This is really cool and I want to keep writing but I'll wait until another time.

Also, this is a complete overwrite of the test post I made earlier using this system so, we'll see if it can update correctly.

EDIT: IT UPDATED CORRECTLY! AND I GET TO EDIT IT FROM THE PROGRAM TO SO SICK
